                This quiz will test your knowledge on various aspects of Medieval and early Renaissance armour. Throughout, the questions vary in difficulty from specialist to general knowledge.
                It is my hope that as you repeatedly play, you will learn a great deal about this fascinating subject.
                Each time you complete the quiz, you will receive 7 random questions from a question bank of 15 total questions.
                All of the questions are multiple choice. Note that you must click on the text or white-space to answer a question.

                This was a first attempt at a project using JavaScript and CSS; and my first use of HTML in anything other than webscraping. It was a great learning experience.
